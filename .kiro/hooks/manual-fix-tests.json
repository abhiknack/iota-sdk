For each failing test:\n   - Read the error message and stack trace\n   - Examine the test code and implementation\n   - Fix incrementally (don't rewrite everything)\n   - Run the specific test: `go test -v ./path -run TestName`\n   - Verify it passes before moving to the next\n\n4. After all fixes, run `make test` to ensure no regressions\n\nProvide a summary of tests fixed and any remaining issues."
